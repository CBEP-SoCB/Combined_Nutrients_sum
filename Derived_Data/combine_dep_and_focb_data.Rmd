#Introduction
This repository was created  to compare nutrient data received from Friends 
of Casco Bay and from Maine DEP.  Initially, this was to ensure that we are 
not double counting nutrient samples.  When we discovered that there is little
or no sample overlap between the two data sources, we extended the archive to 
combine data from both sourcesinto one data set for display purposes. 

There is no "Original_Data" folder for this repository.  All data was derived 
from sources in "DEP_nutrients" and "FOCB_Nutrients" repositories, and copied 
here.

"DEP_nutrients"   ->  'dep_nutrient_data.csv'
"FOCB_Nutrients"  ->  'focb_n_data_strict.csv'

In this notebook, we use a simple strategy, using `inner_join()` to check for 
samples that match with regards to date and site, and examine the TN and NOx 
data from the two sources to see if they are similar.

We find only four samples where DEP and FOCB sampled the same location on the 
same dates.  Reported TN and NOx values do not match.  We conclude that these
are independent data sources.

# Load Data
## DEP Data
```{r}
fn <- 'dep_nutrient_data.csv'

dep_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn )) %>%
  select(site, dt, depth, nox_n, nh4_n, tn) %>%
  mutate(din = nox_n + nh4_n) %>%
  filter(! is.na(tn) & ! is.na(din)) %>%
  select(-nh4_n, -nox_n) %>%
  mutate(source = 'DEP') %>%
  relocate(source) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(din, tn), names_to = 'parameter', values_to = 'concentration')
```

## FOCB Data
```{r}
fn <- 'focb_n_data_strict.csv'

focb_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn )) %>%
  select(station, dt, tn_depth, din_depth, din_N, tn) %>%
  filter(! is.na(tn) & ! is.na(din_N)) %>%
  rename(site = station) %>%
  mutate(source = 'FOCB') %>%
  rename(din = din_N) %>%
  relocate(source) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(din, tn), 
               names_to = 'parameter', 
               values_to = 'concentration') %>%
  mutate(depth = if_else(parameter == 'tn', tn_depth, din_depth)) %>%
  select(-tn_depth, -din_depth) %>%
  relocate(depth , .after = 'dt')
```

## Combine Data
```{r}
mixed_data <- dep_data %>% bind_rows(focb_data) %>%
  mutate(year  = as.numeric(format(dt, format = '%Y')),
         month = as.numeric(format(dt, format = '%m')),
         month = factor(month, 
                        levels = 1:12, 
                        labels = month.abb),
         doy   = as.numeric(format(dt, format = '%j'))) %>%
  mutate(parameter = factor(parameter, 
                            levels = c('din', 'tn'), 
                            labels = c('DIN', 'TN'))) %>%
  relocate(year, month, doy, .after = dt)
```

## Restrict to Recent Surface Samples
```{r}
surface_data <- mixed_data %>%
  filter(depth <= 1, year > 2014)
```

## Filter Out Data From Sites with Few Samples
We filter out data for each parameter from any sites that did not have at least
five samples for that parameter since 2015.  We add data on the number of years 
each site was sampled.
```{r}
surface_data <- surface_data %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  mutate(nTN = sum(parameter == 'TN'),
         nDIN = sum(parameter == 'DIN')) %>%
  mutate(concentration = if_else(parameter == 'TN' & nTN < 5, 
                                NA_real_, 
                                concentration)) %>%
  mutate(concentration = if_else(parameter == 'DIN' & nDIN < 5, 
                                NA_real_, 
                                concentration)) %>%
  ungroup(site) %>%
  select(-nTN, -nDIN, -depth) %>%
  filter(! is.na(concentration))
```

# Output Resulting data
```{r}
write_csv(surface_data, file.path(sibling, "combined_surface_data.csv"))
```

# Evaluate Prevalence of Data By Year
```{r}
prevalence <- surface_data %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(nTN = sum(parameter == 'TN'),
         nDIN = sum(parameter == 'DIN'),
         sampledTN = nTN > 0,
         sampledDIN = nDIN > 0,
         .groups = 'drop_last')
```

```{r fig.width = 4, fig.height = 7}
prevalence %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, site)) +
  geom_tile() +
  xlab('') +
  ylab('') +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9))
```
So a fair number of sites were sampled in only one year, especially by DEP.  If 
we  drop all those locations, we end up with a much reduced number of locations 
we can show on the map.  We chose to hold onto all possible sites with at least 
five samples.

# Data Summary
There are a handful of replicate or near replicate values, or at least samples
collected at the same date and site.  Al lare in the FOCB data, and probably
only represent data nominally collected from different depths (DIN and TN depths
were often recorded differently). To address that, we average across all samples
collected at one site and date by each organization **before** we calculate
descriptive statistics.
```{r core_results}
surface_results <- surface_data %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = source:doy, 
              names_from = parameter, 
              values_from = concentration,
              values_fn = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarize(across(.cols = c(DIN, TN),
                   .fns = c(mn = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                            sd = ~ sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                            n = ~sum(! is.na(.x)),
                            md = ~ median(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                            iqr = ~ IQR(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                            p90 = ~ quantile(.x, .9, na.rm = TRUE),
                            gm = ~ exp(mean(log(.x), na.rm = TRUE)))),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(site = fct_reorder(factor(site), TN_md))
```

## TN Results
```{r}
surface_results %>%
  select(site, contains('TN'))
```

## DIN Results
```{r}
surface_results %>%
  select(site, contains('DIN'))
```
