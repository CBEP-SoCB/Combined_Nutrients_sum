#Introduction
This repository was created  to compare nutrient data received from Friends 
of Casco Bay and from Maine DEP.  initially, this was to to ensure that we are 
not double counting nutrient samples.  When we discovered that there is little
or no sample overlap between the two data sources, we extended the archive to 
combine data from both sources  into one data set for display purposes. 

There is no "Original_Data" folder for this repository.  All data was derived 
from sources in "DEP_nutrients" and "FOCB_Nutrients" repositories, and copied 
here.

"DEP_nutrients"   ->  'dep_nutrient_data.csv'
"FOCB_Nutrients"  ->  'focb_n_data_strict.csv'

In this notebook, we use a simple strategy, using `inner_join()` to check for 
samples that match with regards to date and site, and examine the TN and NOx 
data from the two sources to see if they are similar.

We find only four samples where DEP and FOCB sampled the same location on the 
same dates.  Reported TN and NOx values do not match.  We conclude that these
are independent data sources.

# Load Libraries
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)

library(GGally)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Folder References
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sibling <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
```

# Load Data
## DEP Data
```{r}
fn <- 'dep_nutrient_data.csv'
dep_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn )) %>%
  select(site, dt, depth, nox_n, tn) %>%
  filter(! is.na(tn) & ! is.na(nox_n)) %>%
  mutate(source = 'DEP') %>%
  relocate(source)
```

## FOCB Data
```{r}
fn <- 'focb_n_data_strict.csv'
focb_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn )) %>%
  select(station, dt, tn_depth, din_depth, nox_N, tn) %>%
  filter(! is.na(tn) & ! is.na(nox_N)) %>%
  rename(site = station) %>%
  mutate(source = 'FOCB') %>%
  relocate(source)
```

# Compare Data
```{r}
mixed_data <- dep_data %>%
  inner_join(focb_data, by = c('site', 'dt'))
mixed_data %>%
  select(site, dt, nox_n, nox_N, tn.x, tn.y)
```

So the FOCB and DEP data only overlap on four days and locations, and the 
underlying data values are not the same, suggesting these are truly independent
samples, despite overlaps of names.
