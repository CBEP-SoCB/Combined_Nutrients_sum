# Geospatial data
## `combined_nutients.mdb`
The personal geodatabase included here contains two data layers,
`combined_locations` and `surface results`  Contents are derived from the
"*.csv"" files in the enclosing `Data` folder.  

`combined_locations` <- 'combined_locations.csv'
`surface results`    <- 'surface_recent_results.csv'

Files were imported as tables, turned to spatial information based on "Display
XY Data...`, and saved to the geodatabase.  Attributes are as described for the
`*.csv` files.
